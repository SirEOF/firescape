'''Barbarians''' are [[monster]]s which are mostly found in the [[Barbarian Village]]. They have a combat level of 16.

There are also some who are non-aggressive. Some are involved with quests, and some are shopkeepers, such as [[Peksa]], who owns a helmet shop in Barbarians Village.

== Training ==
Barbarians are can be a good option for low to mid level players who who wish to train their combat skills. There is [[Cooked meat]] and [[beer]] spawn located in the longhouse of the village, which can be used a free food source. 

Barbarians drop somewhat valuable items and some players may choose to kill them in search of loot which they can use to train their skills, collect, or [[trade]] to other players. Killing Barbarians at the Barbarian Village and banking in west [[Varrock]] is the best method for players seeking to collect loot obtained from killing them.

It is easy to get normal barbarians and [[Gunthor the Brave]] mixed up. This can be dangerous for players who don't have higher combat skills, as he hits higher than normal barbarians and also has more [[hitpoints]]. 

== Dialogue ==
* Attempting to talk to one yields a message saying either "''ug''", "''grr''", "''the barbarian grunts''", "''the barbarian ignores you''" or something else. 

* Sometimes you will have a small conversation with them, after saying "''Hello''", the barbarian asks "''Who are you?''. You then say "''I'm a bold adventurer''" and the barbarian responds "''You don't look very strong''".

== Appearance ==
The barbarians are light skin toned men with yellow beards. They are wearing [[Leather Armour]], a brown shirt, brown pants, and appear to be wearing an [[iron]] or [[steel]] [[Helmet|medium helmet.]] They are wielding what is most likely an iron or steel [[Battle axes|battle axe]].

== Trivia ==
* In [[RuneScape 2|''RuneScape 2'']], Barbarians use their axe as a two-handed weapon. However, in RuneScape Classic, the barbarians use their axe as a one-handed weapon. Also, in RuneScape 2, Barbarians appear to wear a [[Medium Bronze Helmet|Bronze Medium Helmet]].
