'''Black dragons''' are the strongest type of [[dragon]]s out of the colours of dragons - [[blue dragon|blue]], [[red dragon|red]] and black. The [[King Black Dragon]] is the only dragon that is stronger than black dragons. Black dragons can be found in [[Taverley dungeon]] and the [[Lava Maze dungeon]].
==Equipment==
Like all dragons, fighting them using the [[Paralyze Monster]] prayer is very helpful as they cannot attack back. Bringing [[restore prayer potion]]s would be wise to restore prayer points if using this prayer.
