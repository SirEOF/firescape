The '''Black Knight titan''' is a [[monster]] encountered during [[The Holy Grail]] quest. The last damage the players deals to him must be done with [[Excalibur]] in order to defeat him, but during this stage he does not move and can be killed more easily using [[ranged]] or [[magic]]. His appearance is that of a larger [[Black Knight]].
