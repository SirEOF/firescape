'''Black unicorns''' are [[monster]]s found in the eastern [[Wilderness]].
These are commonly killed for their [[Unicorn horn|unicorn horns]] by players training [[Herblaw|herblore]] or looking to sell the horns for profit. There are many in the area and no need to wait for spawns, making it a popular place to hunt them. It would be a good idea to bring [[Varrock Teleport|Varrock teleportation]] runes for quick escape (Level 25 magic required) if a PKer should come, and for faster banking. If you're high enough level, you can bring only a weapon, leaving more inventory space for unicorn horns.

Black unicorns, like [[Unicorn|other unicorns]], will retreat when they are low on health. It can be time consuming to chase them down every time they run off. One way to avoid this is to retreat 1 square away as soon as their health drops below 1/3, and then attack again to finish the kill. This way, they don't have a chance to run off.
