'''Blue dragons''' are the weakest type of [[dragon]] in [[RuneScape Classic]], and they are popular for training combat among high-levelled players because of their [[dragon bones]]. They can be found within the [[Taverley dungeon]], [[Ogre Enclave]] and in the basement of the [[Heroes' Guild]]. To train at the Heroes' Guild, you will need to have completed the [[Hero's Quest]].

Blue dragons that are found in the [[Ogre Enclave]] are only accessible during [[Watchtower (quest)|Watchtower]] [[quest]]. The [[cave entrance]] to the enclave gets walled in after the [[quest]].

==Equipment==
These dragons are powerful. It is suggested that you either bring good food, or use [[Paralyze Monster]]. If you plan to train in the Taverley dungeon, it is suggested that you bring [[restore prayer potion]]s so that you can replenish your [[Prayer]] points. However, if you plan to train on the blue dragons beneath the Heroes' Guild, you will not need these potions, as there is an [[Altar|altar]] on the top floor of the guild.
