'''Darkwizards'''{{sic}} are [[monster]]s located at the stone circle south of [[Varrock]], near the bank of [[Draynor Village]], in the [[Wilderness]], in the [[Dark Wizards Tower]], on top of [[Wizards' Tower]], and inside [[Strange Barrel]]s. Fighting these can prove to be a good way to make money because they commonly drop [[runes]] for high-level [[spells]].

==Trivia==
*Darkwizards were renamed to Dark Wizards in [[RuneScape 2]], and began to use [[magic]] instead of [[melee]].
*Even though they wear a hood they drop a [[wizardshat]].
