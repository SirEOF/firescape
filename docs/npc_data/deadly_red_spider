'''Deadly Red spiders''' are [[monster]]s which can be found within the [[Varrock sewers]], [[Edgeville]] dungeon, the eastern ruins in the [[wilderness]], crawling near the[[rune rock| ]][[Wilderness runite mine]] in level 45 wilderness, in the [[Karamja]] volcano, and inside [[Strange Barrel]]s. Deadly red spiders can often be found near [[red spiders eggs]]. Deadly Red Spiders do not drop red spiders eggs.

Some players consider killing these to be a fairly decent combat training method, due to the XP rates one can attain. The drawback to killing red spiders for XP is that they drop nothing, yielding no profit for the player.

They were the second spider enemy types to be added to the game, just a month after launch. The spider's visual appearance is a red variant copy of the preceding level 2 [[Spider]] and level 8 [[Giant Spider]].
