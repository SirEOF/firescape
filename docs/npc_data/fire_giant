'''Fire Giants''' are [[monster]]s which were released in [[2002#May|May 2002]]; their first location was within the [[Waterfall dungeon]] underneath the [[Baxtorian Falls]]. In September 2002, the [[Waterfall Quest]] was released, which involves portions of this dungeon. Following the quest's release, players were now required to have equipped [[Glarial's Amulet]] in order to enter the [[Waterfall Dungeon]].

Fire Giants are a popular choice to kill for strong players, as they are known to drop both the [[Dragon medium helmet]] and the [[Half Dragon Square Shield|Half Dragon Square Shield.]] Fire Giants have also become a notable source of [[Dragonstone]]s, which became considerably more rare due to the [[Crystal chest]] in [[Taverly]] being inoperable as result of an ongoing bug which is unlikely to be fixed.
