A '''Gnome Baller''' is one of the many gnomes encountered during the [[Gnome Ball (minigame)|Gnome Ball]] minigame. In the minigame the Gnome Ballers try to tackle the player to stop the player from scoring. When a Gnome Baller successfully tackles the player, he or she will receive 1 or 2 [[Hits]] of damage.
