'''Goblins''' are a common [[monster]] for new players to train on. There are many wandering around in [[Lumbridge]], where players start, so they are commonly one of the first monsters players will ever kill. They are great monsters to train on because they are weak, making them easy to kill. Although these monsters are great to train on and gain profit from at lower levels, not many players kill them.
