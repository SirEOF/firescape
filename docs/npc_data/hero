'''Heroes''' are [[monster]]s located in [[East Ardougne]]. They can be thieved at level 80 [[Thieving]] for 274 XP. They are not recommended for efficient thieving training due to low success rates. Killing them is not known to be a good method of obtaining combat experience, because of their high hit points. They also do not drop anything of value.
