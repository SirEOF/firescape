'''Iban disciples''' are [[monster]]s found during the [[Underground Pass]] quest. They are followers of [[Iban]] and worship [[Zamorak]].

Iban disciples will always drop [[Zamorak robes]] during the [[Underground Pass]] [[quest]]. However, after the quest they will drop Zamorak robes only if the player has a repaired [[Staff of Iban]] in bank or with them. If the player has no Staff of Iban then they will drop broken version of Staff of Iban and you will have to pay [[Dark Mage]] in [[West Ardougne]] 200,000 [[coins]] to repair it.
