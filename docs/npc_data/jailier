The '''Jailer''' is a [[monster]] who guards the [[Black Knight]] jail deep in the [[Taverley dungeon]]. After he is killed he drops a key that unlocks the cell. Once inside the cell players can obtain the [[dusty key]] which is required for accessing the dungeon further. This step is completed during the [[Hero's Quest]].
