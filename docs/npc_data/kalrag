'''Kalrag''' is a [[monster]] who plays an important role in the [[Underground Pass]] quest. A player must kill it to smear "'''Iban's blood'''" on [[a Doll of Iban]] to get to the next step in the quest.

Prior to the release of [[RuneScape 2]] this area was a popular place to [[Melee training|train melee]] at higher levels. Owing to this is the fact that when Kalrag is killed, [[Blessed Spider|his followers]] become aggressive towards the player.
