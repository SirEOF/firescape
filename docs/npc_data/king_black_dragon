The '''King Black Dragon''' (or '''KBD''') is the strongest and highest leveled [[monster]] which can be found living in [[Gielinor]] on [[RuneScape Classic|''RuneScape Classic'']]. He is capable of inflicting [[poison]] damage on a player. Players usually fight the dragon alone using [[melee]], but it is possible to have another player [[ranged|ranging]] or [[magic|casting spells]] on him from afar. He can be found in [[King Black Dragon lair|his lair]] deep inside the [[Wilderness]] near the Lava maze. The ladder leading down to his lair is surrounded by several{{Clarify}} [[Lesser demon]]s. The KBD is often fought for its rare and valuable drops including the [[uncut dragonstone]], [[left half dragon square shield]] and [[dragon medium helmet]].

==Recommended Equipment==
*[[Rune Plate Mail Body]]
*[[Rune Plate Mail Legs]] or [[Rune Plated Skirt]]
*[[Dragon Medium Helmet]]
*[[Anti-dragon shield]] (see note below)
*[[Dragon sword]]
*[[Charged Dragonstone Amulet]] (for [[teleportation|teleporting]] out)
*[[Cure poison potion]]s or [[Poison antidote]]s
'''Note:''' The [[Anti-dragon shield]] is only needed at the start of a fight with the King black dragon, and some players choose to retreat and switch to a [[Rune kite shield]] or [[Dragon square shield]] for increased [[defense]] immediately after taking the first hit.

The same gear would be used by a mage with the addition of a chosen god cape/spell and [[charge]]. Players using ranged should use a [[magic longbow]] and [[rune arrows]].

Note an [[Anti-dragon shield]] is only needed at the start of a fight with the King black dragon, and some players choose to retreat and switch to a [[Rune kite shield]] or [[Dragon square shield]] for increased [[defense]] immediately after taking the first hit
