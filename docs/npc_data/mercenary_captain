The '''Mercenary Captain''' is the leader of all of the [[Mercenary|Mercenaries]] in the [[Desert Mining Camp]], and is hired to guard the entrance of it to prevent people accessing the camp and discovering the slave-trade that was going on there. The Mercenary Captain plays a role in the [[Tourist Trap]] quest, in which he must be provoked to the point of outrage so that he initiates [[combat]] with the player himself, rather than having his mercenaries do his dirty work for him. After being killed by the player, the Captain drops a [[Metal key]] which can open the gate to the Desert Mining Camp.
