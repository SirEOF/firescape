A '''Monk''' is an [[monster|attackable NPC]] that is found at the [[Monestary|Monastery]], [[Entrana]] and in many [[church]]es. Monks are holy characters that are dressed on [[monk's robes]], however, they do not drop them upon death. [[Abbot Langley]] is a well known monk who resides on the ground floor of the Monestary. He can restore players [[Hits]] upon request which is a reason why monks are often killed at the monastery as no [[food]] is required.
