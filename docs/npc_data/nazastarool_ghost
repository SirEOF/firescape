The '''Nazasatrool Ghost''' is a [[monster]] which must be killed in [[Rashiliyia's Tomb]] in order to complete the [[Shilo Village (quest)|Shilo Village]] quest. If the player leaves combat, its [[hits]] will restore completely. For this reason, [[food]] is not an option when killing it, and it is highly recommended to use the [[Paralyze Monster]] prayer during the fight with the ghost. It is weakened by equipping the [[Beads of the dead]] which is given to the player during the Shilo Village quest. Using any kind of [[magic]] spells to attack the ghost will cause the player to be choked.
