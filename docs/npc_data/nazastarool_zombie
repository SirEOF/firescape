The '''Nazastarool Zombie''' is a [[monster]] which must be killed in [[Rashiliyia's Tomb]] in order to complete the [[Shilo Village (quest)|Shilo Village]] quest. If its opponent leaves combat, its [[hits]] will restore completely. For this reason, [[food]] is not an option, and it is recommended to use the [[Paralyze Monster]] prayer during the fight. It is weakened by wearing [[Beads of the dead]]. Using [[magic]] to attack it will cause players to be choked.
