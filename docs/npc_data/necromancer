A [[Necromancer]] is a [[monster]] that summons [[zombie]]s when provoked. Usually, they will summon up to 7 after which the Necromancer can be defeated. Due to an oversight, an infinite amount of [[zombie]]s can be summoned, allowing quick combat [[experience]]. They turn into a [[zombie]] after defeat. The Necromancer is a source of the [[Zamorak robe top]] and the [[Zamorak robe bottom]], the other being [[Iban disciple]]s.
