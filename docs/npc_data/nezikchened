'''Nezikchened''' is a powerful [[demon]] found deep in the jungles of southern [[Karamja]]. He is encountered three times during the [[Legends' Quest]] and holds the title for the most powerful quest monster in [[RuneScape Classic]].

==First battle==
Nezikchened has possessed [[Ungadulu]] and is released with the [[Booking of Binding]]. The player's [[prayer]] skill is drained and retreating will cause the battle to restart from the beginning - Nezikchened having full [[hits]].

==Second battle==
Nezikchened is disguised as the ghost [[Echned Zekin]] and provides the player with a [[Dark Dagger]] with which to kill the spirit [[Viyeldi]]. When the player has returned (regardless of whether [[Viyeldi]] has been killed) he will reveal his true form and attack, draining the player's prayer level to around 25, depending on their level. At 51 prayer, he will drain it completely.

==Third battle==
Nezikchened attacks when the player attempts to place the [[Totem Pole]]. [[Prayer]] is not drained, so [[Paralyze Monster]] can easily be used.

==Drops==
