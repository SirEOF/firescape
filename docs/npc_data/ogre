An '''ogre''' is a large human-like [[monster]]. They can be found west or south of [[Yanille]] around [[Gu'Tanoth]], and at the [[Combat Training Camp]] (which can only be accessed after completing the quest [[Biohazard]]). The training camp is an excellent way to train [[range]]d or [[magic]] as the ogres are caged and cannot be attacked with [[melee]]. Their [[hostility]] varies by location{{clarify}}; they can be either aggressive or combative.
