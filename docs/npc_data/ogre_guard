'''Ogre guards''' are [[monster]]s that walk around [[Gu'Tanoth]]. They are located in the marketplace, near the southeast and northwest [[gate]]s, aswell as in the south by the [[battlement]] and [[rock]] obstacle.

Only the two marketplace (level 96) guards who guard the [[cave entrance]] to [[Ogre Enclave]] may be attacked. They respawn immediately after being killed.
