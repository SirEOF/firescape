'''Otherworldly beings''' are [[monster]]s found in the south-west most point of [[Zanaris]]. Excluding their clothing; otherworldly beings are invisible, which is one of many bizarre features of the city.

Due to being non-aggressive, Otherworldly beings are not commonly fought by players for combat training. However, since they commonly drop expensive runes, they do attract some players.
