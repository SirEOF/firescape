'''Skeletons''' are [[monster]]s which reside throughout [[RuneScape Classic]]. They can easily kill an unsuspecting player that wanders through the wrong section of the [[wilderness]] or into the [[Taverley dungeon]]. They are the first monster encountered when a player enters the [[Taverley dungeon]]. While skeletons can be dangerous (and even lethal) to lower-leveled players, many medium and high-leveled players train on skeletons with ease.

A skeleton will also attack the player during [[The Restless Ghost]] quest.
