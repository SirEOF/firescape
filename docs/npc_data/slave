==Dialogue==
The slaves attack when the conversation ends.

* ''the man seems to be in a weak state of mind''

===White beard===
* '''Player:''' hello, are you ok?
* '''slave:''' Oh yes, you're a fine one. Nice red cheeks, shiny hair
* '''slave:''' Let's see now, some potatoes, some cabbage, 
* '''slave:''' maybe half a clove of garlic
* '''slave:''' ... yes I think you'd make a fine soup
* '''slave:''' You don't mind do you?
* '''Player:''' actually i do
* '''slave:''' You're welcome to have some with me of course.

===Grey hair===
* '''Player:''' hello
* '''slave:''' Eating me... they keep eating me!
* '''slave:''' Eating me from the inside. Please stop them eating me
* '''slave:''' ... I can feel them wriggling inside me right now
* '''slave:''' ... please stop them!

===Red face===
* '''Player:''' hello
* '''slave:''' What's that... is that a dagger I see before me?
* '''slave:''' Why should I bear the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune?
* '''slave:''' for what is man but the quintessence of dust?
* '''slave:''' And so I say goodnight sweet prince. The rest is silence.

===Blonde beard===
* '''Player:''' hi
* '''Slave:''' Kill the villagers, burn them all- every last one
* '''Slave:''' I want nothing to survive: nothing but the sweet smell of burning flesh
* '''Player:''' you're ill
* '''Slave:''' What's that - you've never smelt it before
* '''Slave:''' Well, let's just say it's an acquired taste

===Brown hair===
* '''Player:''' hello
* '''slave:''' Danger, everywhere danger! But not from man nor beast-
* '''slave:''' no this is the dagner that is inside you.
* '''slave:''' Bring it out, nurture it, cherish it
* '''slave:''' Stroke it like you would stork a wounded bird-
* '''slave:''' then strange it before it takes hold of your very being
* '''slave:''' Don't say I didn't warn you

This slave in particular doesn't attack when the conversation ends.

* '''Player''': hi

* '''Slave''': GBPP DNG SKTD DELP! GBPP DNG SKTD DELP!
