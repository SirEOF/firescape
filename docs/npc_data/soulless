'''Souless''' are [[monster|monsters]] encountered in the [[Underground Pass (location)|Underground Pass]] during the quest, [[Underground Pass]]. They are servants of [[Iban]] and appear to be a deformed humanoid life form.

== Combat training ==
They are sometimes used for melee [[combat]] training, but they are in a location that is time consuming to travel to, which makes them unpopular with some players. They drop nothing other than bones.
