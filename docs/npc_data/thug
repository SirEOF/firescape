'''Thugs''' are aggressive [[monster]]s found in the [[Edgeville dungeon]] and in level 5 [[wilderness]] north of Edgeville. They are a decent source of nature-runes for lower levels, and grant good experience for lower levels. Thugs are aggressive and attack players on sight because they are located in the wilderness. This makes killing them a relatively efficient to train combat skills at lower levels, however higher level players may experience there are too few Thugs to be worthwhile.
