'''UndeadOnes''' are undead [[monster]]s said to be under the control of [[Rashiliyia]]. They can be found attacking the entrance to [[Shilo Village (location)|Shilo Village]], but do not disappear when the [[Shilo Village (quest)|Shilo Village quest]] is completed and [[Rashiliyia]] is defeated. They are far more aggressive than a normal monster; they will detect players several steps away from them.

The spell [[Crumble undead]] does '''not''' work on UndeadOnes.
