'''Witches''' are [[monster]]s who are capable of wielding [[magic]] and wear evidently mystical outfits, mostly including a pointed hat. One has been spotted in southeastern [[Al Kharid]], as well as [[Draynor Manor]]. Much like [[wizard]]s and [[darkwizard]]s, they are not capable of using [[magic]] in combat, and instead opt for [[melee]]. A non-attackable witch is featured in the [[Black Knights' Fortress (quest)|Black Knight's Fortress]] [[quest]].
