'''Wizards''' are [[monster]]s with a [[combat level]] of 16 which can be found in various places around [[RuneScape Classic]]. Unlike wizards in [[RuneScape 2]], they use melee instead of [[magic]]. They are often killed for their [[Wizard Robe]], which is arguably best item for mages that is worn on the torso.
